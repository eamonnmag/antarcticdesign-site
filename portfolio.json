We were asked to create an engaging website with a focus on two key aspects: donations and crowd sourced annotations. We have been doing a lot with isometric illustrations recently and thought that this project would lend itself well to it given what we were trying to convey about the project. Dr. Tom Hart, who commissioned this work was very pleased with the results and donations have risen considerably since its deployment in March.",

We will analyze 200,000 samples from these communities using metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and amplicon sequencing to produce a global Gene Atlas describing protein space, environmental metabolic models for each biome, approximately 500,000 reconstructed microbial genomes, a global metabolic model, and a data-analysis portal for visualization of all information.\" EMP Website",
